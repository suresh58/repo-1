In order to connect to the VNC session you will need a VNC viewer application.
Realvnc.com offeres free viewers.  They have installers for linux, windows, and OSX.

After downloading and installing the VNC viewer connect to your lab server IP followed by the port.
The port for the VNC session is :5901

So for example 192.192.192.192:5901 is what you would use to connect to your lab server from the Real VNC viewer application.
